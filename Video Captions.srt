Hi,I'm MartÃ­ Mas and in collaboration with

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:03,498
DXC Technology,

3
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:04,877
we are presenting the roject "Tuning

00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:07,267

00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:10,481
blic Administrationssupervised by

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,434
Josep Suy.

8
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:14,487
We built a system that gives a L

9
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:16,743
arge Language Model access to databases

10
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:19,375
or websites and is customizable to client

11
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,631
needs through BPMNs using Flowable. The

12
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:22,356
databases or websites

13
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:24,352
provided by the clients contain

14
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:26,232
up-to-date information. The system can

15
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:28,112
answer user queries truthfully by

16
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,993
augmenting the model's ability to

17
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:32,249
generate text with the ability to

18
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,129
retrieve information from these databases

19
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:34,646
or websites.

20
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,165
Retrieval is done intelligently by

21
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,919
finding the most semantically relevant

22
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:41,877
pieces of information in the database.

23
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:45,534
With this system, we avoid hallucinations

24
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:48,036
while allowing for a wide range of

25
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:49,466
possible configurations different clients

26
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,181
might require.

27
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,570
This is called the Retrieval Augmented

28
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,923
Generationor RAG. We implement

29
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:57,669
a custom RAG solution called Small-T

30
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:59,986
o-Big-Retrieval which is able to query

31
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:01,641
the documents from multiple semantic

32
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,088
levels at the same time.

33
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,654
On the frontend, for accessibility

34
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,640
reasons, we deploy on edge machine

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,580
learning to perform hotword recognition

36
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,041
on the user's machine. This is done on

37
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,503
edge for privacy reasons as we don't want

38
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:17,656
to constantly send microphone data to the

39
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,052
cloud. Chatbot.

40
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,439
Using machine learning, we first classify

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,408
user queries into two categories, hard

42
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:30,361
ones and easy ones. We then choose to use

43
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,986
a larger or a smaller Language Model to

44
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,955
answer the queries based on this

45
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,595
classification, reducing costs. This is

46
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,579
called RouteLLM.

47
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,187
We also implement measures to restrict

48
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:42,341
the behavior of language models to stick

49
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:43,880
to their stakeholders needs and

50
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,187
guidelines.

51
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,546
The system refuses to answer questions

52
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:48,588
outside the scope defined by the

53
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,289
stakeholders or questions that might

54
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,309
abuse the system.

55
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,528
Here's a quick demo of how it all

56
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:56,937
comes together. Here a

57
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:57,290
stakeholder , the "Departament de Drets Socials

58
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:01,164
de la Generalitat" wants to help citizens

59
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,630
know how social rights work and what

60
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,208
social benefits

61
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:06,392
they might have access to. The system

62
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,857
asks a few questions to understand the

63
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:10,619
user's situation and recommends possible

64
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,084
benefits that might be available to them.

65
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:15,661
Thank you for your attention.
